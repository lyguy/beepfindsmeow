A zen simulator. After [robotfindskitten](http://robotfindskitten.org).

You are ``beep`` (`#`). You find `meow`, and there are things which are not `meow`.

## Build
You will need [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) and [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) installed.
Once they're installed use the `Makefile` to build it:
```
make
```
or install it:
```
make install
```

Then you can just run it:
```
beepfindsmeow
```
